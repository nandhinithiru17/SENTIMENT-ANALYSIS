🌟 Overview 🔍 Goal: Develop a robust sentiment analysis model to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. 💡 Approach:

Clean and preprocess raw textual data. Train and evaluate machine learning models for sentiment classification. Deploy the model in Huggingface space for real-world usage. 📽️ Visual Representation

Sentiment Analysis Workflow

🎯 Objective 1️⃣ Preprocess textual data for better model performance. 2️⃣ Transform text using advanced vectorization techniques like tokenization. 3️⃣ Train and evaluate machine learning algorithms for sentiment classification. 4️⃣ Deploy an interactive application for real-time sentiment predictions.

🛠️ Data Preprocessing Steps 1️⃣ Text Cleaning:

Removed HTML tags, URLs, and special characters. Tokenized text using nltk. Lowercased and lemmatized words for consistency. 2️⃣ Feature Extraction:

Applied Vectorization to represent text numerically. 🏋️‍♂️ Training Process Split data into Train (80%) and Test (20%) sets. Evaluated models using cross-validation with metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

🌐 Deployment 🌟 Interactive Web Application: Deployed the sentiment analysis model using gradio. Features:

Upload input sentences directly. Real-time sentiment predictions. 🚀 Conclusion and Future Work ✅ Conclusion:

Successfully built and deployed a sentiment analysis pre trained model with 90% accuracy. Demonstrated the application in real-world scenarios using a user-friendly interface. 🔮 Future Improvements:

Explore Deep Learning techniques like BERT. Handle sarcasm and contextual nuances in text. Expand the dataset for better generalization. 📦 Key Libraries Used Pandas Scikit-learn NLTK
